Step1: Install and Config Oracle - Refer to the Manual for step and parameters
   1.1: Install the oracle DB
   1.2: Create the DB --> 1 or many DB with diff names
         - DB server la localhost (predefined in the hosts file)
         - Can use IP or name (predefined in the hosts file)
   1.3: Configure the Listener
   1.4: Set net Name va test bang sys or system voi password da cai san



Step 2: Create a normal user (diff from sys and system as sysdba) - the pwd can be same or diff
- This is the working user for IDE and Eclipse connect
- Import the DB by USER JUSt CREATED
- Script is provided

Note:
- Oracle has tablespace - diff tablespace is all diff
- All the Oracle DBs tables resources belong to the user created them - we can assign to other users



Step 3: Run the Application
- Make sure the DB run by Test at Assistant, then 
		start the lsnrctl>start
		start the instance by sqlplus: sqlplus / as sysdba >connect / as sysdba >startup 
- Connect to DB with user XXX and check for user table
- Change the connection configuration in context.xml
- Run the ATMP
- Run the ViewServer/SMS Server/ EMail Server
- Run the to Tomcat - Remeber to set the Variables enviroment
		check all the parameters on the console are correct
- Run the application using http://127.0.0.1:8080/emapp/
- Default pass is admin/000000

Problen/Solving
1: Invalid Password
- Check for the oracle DB connection "url" and the "port" 1521 (default, set on the setting of listener) in the context.xml
- Besides context.xml file, if the errors happens, check on the cmsbean.xml file
- Set the timeout to see which lines of DB configuration that the app access to connect to the DB
2: No Listener
- Check to correctly follow all the instructions in the step 1
- Restart the lsnr and db services
